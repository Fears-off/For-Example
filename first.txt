Can you feel that?

Ah, shit



Drowning deep in my sea of loathing

Broken your servant I kneel

(Will you give in to me?)

It seems what's left of my human side

Is slowly changing in me

(Will you give in to me?)


Looking at my own reflection

When suddenly it changes

Violently it changes (oh no)

There is no turning back now

You've woken up the demon in me


Get up, come on get down with the sickness [x3]

Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Your mother get up come on get down with the sickness

Your fucker get up come on get down with the sickness

Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

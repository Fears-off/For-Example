

(And when I dream) [x4]

No mommy, don't do it again

Don't do it again

I'll be a good boy

I'll be a good boy, I promise

No mommy don't hit me

Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?

Don't do it, you're hurting me

Why did you have to be such a bitch

Why don't you,

Why don't you just fuck off and die

Why can't you just fuck off and die

Why can't you just leave here and die

Never stick your hand in my face again bitch

FUCK YOU

I don't need this shit

You stupid sadistic abusive fucking whore

How would you like to see how it feels mommy

Here it comes, get ready to die



Get up, come on get down with the sickness [x3]

Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Your mother get up come on get down with the sickness

Your fucker get up come on get down with the sickness

Madness has now come over me

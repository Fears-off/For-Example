
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising

Don't try to deny what you feel

(Will you give in to me?)

It seems that all that was good has died

And is decaying in me

(Will you give in to me?)


It seems you're having some trouble

In dealing with these changes

Living with these changes (oh no)

The world is a scary place

Now that you've woken up the demon in me



Get up, come on get down with the sickness [x3]

Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Your mother get up come on get down with the sickness

Your fucker get up come on get down with the sickness

Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
